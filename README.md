# Sports Data Analysis — Decathlon (R)

Exploratory analysis of athletes’ performances from two clubs (**decaRennes** and **ParisII**) across several decathlon events, using descriptive statistics and visualizations in **R**.

## Goals

- Compare performance between clubs across key events (notably 100m, 400m, 1500m).
- Identify trends (e.g., correlation between 100m and 400m), distributions (1500m), and score differences by age group/club.
- Detect and handle outliers/anomalies (e.g., unusual performance values, minimum pole vault score).

## Repository contents

- `Track&Field data analysis.R` — main analysis script (Excel import, descriptive stats, outlier filtering, basic plots, tables).
- `Track&Field Data Analysis Report.pdf` — report with charts + interpretations (scatter + regression, faceted histograms, violin plot, conclusions).
